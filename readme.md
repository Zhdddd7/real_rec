# Real-Rec: A real-time threads recomendation system
Real-Rec is a system project designed for a forum recommendation solution, focusing primarily on real-time content delivery and related recommendation logic, rather than front-end or back-end implementation details.
## Overall goals
* Deliver highly relevant, high-quality post recommendations.
* Provide suitable content feeds when users browse or refresh, and personalized results when they explicitly search.
* Handle a continuous influx of new users and new posts, ensuring effective "cold start" strategies for both.

## Data Layer
### User portrait
* Basic info
* Preferences extraction
* Behavior modeling: browser history, like, favor, comment(depends on actual function scale)
* User search info

### Content portrait
* Textual attributes (title, body)
* Topic/Tag metadata (manually assigned or inferred via NLP)
* Time-based features (publish time, freshness)
* Engagement signals (views, likes, favorites, comments, shares)

### Contextual info
Access time (peak/off-peak times, weekdays/weekends)
